# QSim-NLP-NLP-Question-Matcher-

NLP Question Matcher is an intelligent question-matching system that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and cosine similarity to find the most similar question from a dataset based on user input. The project is designed to help retrieve the most relevant pre-existing questions and their answers by comparing the semantic similarity of the input question with stored questions.


# Features
Natural Language Processing: Utilizes NLP techniques to process and compare questions.
TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts text data into numerical vectors based on word frequencies.
Cosine Similarity: Calculates the similarity between the input question and stored questions using cosine similarity.
Most Similar Question Retrieval: Finds and returns the most similar question from the dataset and its corresponding answer.


# How it Works
Input: The user provides a question they want to match.
TF-IDF Vectorization: All questions (including the userâ€™s input) are transformed into TF-IDF vectors.
Cosine Similarity Calculation: The cosine similarity between the input question and each stored question is computed.
Most Similar Question: The system identifies the most similar question based on the highest similarity score and returns the associated answer.
